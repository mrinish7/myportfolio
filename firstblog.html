        According to "the 1 percent rule," only 1 percent of Internet users actively create new content, while the other 99 percent of the participants simply view it. By blogging, you separate yourself from the 99 percent of people that don't blog. Standing out is essential in an increasingly competitive economy.

        The audience you attract through blogging doesn't have to just be your "audience." They can become your friends, colleagues, partners, or lovers. I've had many people reach out to me directly after reading my blog. Some of those people have become friends or good business contacts.

        Blogging enables you to be your own media company. You can tell your story the way you want to tell it without being dependent on journalists. When you are writing about a topic of your own interest, you can decide how to portray a story, what information to include, and what information to exclude. Blogging allows you to ensure that all information included in the blog is factual.
