                <small>Shang-chi</small>
                <small>september, 2021</small>
                <p>Shang chi and the legend of ten ring is the latest addition in Marvel. The MCU's first film with an asian lead dosen't disappoint. Simu liu has played a role of deadly assassin and heir of the Ten Rings 
                    
                    <br/>Shang-chi(Simu liu), who goes back the time of Shaun, is trying to find/live a normal life in san Francisso, spending his time with his close friend, Katy as they enjoy their time as habitual underachievers and lacking purposeful goals. that particular carefreee lifestyle is soon shatteresd by the sudden apperance of members from the shadowy organization of the Ten Rings 

                    <br/>the movie's ending leaves the door open for further deepening into the mystery of Shang-chi's situation as well as being part of the larger established of the Marvel Superhero universe
                    
                    <br/>a great visual presentation, and a terrific cast, especially Liu's performance. personally i really liked this movie.

                <h1>My first blog</h1>
                <small>septermber, 2021</small>
                <p>Writing blogs can seem to be very difficult sometimes as a number of questions start running in our head.But let me assure you that there are some great reasons why you should start blogging as a developer as soon as possible 

                   <br/> It’s a great way to get better at writing and eventually your typing speed will be a little faster as soon as you start writing blogs . Learning to write well is extremely difficult. The best way to do this is to  set aside some time every week or two week and just start writing. 
                    
                   <br/>  It's gonna be very helpful to showcase in your resume. It's an age of social media where the person who is about to hire you expects you to be active on other social media platforms. Maintaining an impressive personal website with links back to previous jobs has always been a essential for many developers looking for work - especially given the current state of the job market 
                    
                    <br/>You can grow an audience from scratch. Blogging will allow you to build an audience before your project is released, meaning there can be likely a chance to give your project a head start when it’s come out 
                    
                   <br/> It will make you a better communicator, you can use it for several good deeds or to interact with your audience and gain some good general knowledges going through different places or country
