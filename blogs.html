                <p>Writing blogs can seem to be very difficult sometimes as a number of questions start running in our head.But let me assure you that there are some great reasons why you should start blogging as a developer as soon as possible 

                   <br/> It’s a great way to get better at writing and eventually your typing speed will be a little faster as soon as you start writing blogs . Learning to write well is extremely difficult. The best way to do this is to  set aside some time every week or two week and just start writing. 
                    
                   <br/>  It's gonna be very helpful to showcase in your resume. It's an age of social media where the person who is about to hire you expects you to be active on other social media platforms. Maintaining an impressive personal website with links back to previous jobs has always been a essential for many developers looking for work - especially given the current state of the job market 
                    
                    <br/>You can grow an audience from scratch. Blogging will allow you to build an audience before your project is released, meaning there can be likely a chance to give your project a head start when it’s come out 
                    
                   <br/> It will make you a better communicator, you can use it for several good deeds or to interact with your audience and gain some good general knowledges going through different places or country
