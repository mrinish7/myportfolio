        Shang-Chi made his first appearance in the Marvel comic universe in Special Marvel Edition #15 (December 1973). The comic introduced Shang-Chi as the son of Dr. Fu Manchu, who had raised him to be an assassin. In the course of his first mission, Shang-Chi discovers his father’s true nature and vows to fight his father’s ambition for world dominance. The series became an instant financial and critical success. Shang-Chi would continue to appear in Special Marvel Edition #16 and #17 when the title was changed to The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu. The series was created by comic writers Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin.

        Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is off and running. Black Widow may have served as the official launch of Phase Four, though for unclear reasons as to why it ties in beyond it’s post-credits scene, but I suspect that fans of the MCU will look back on Black Widow’s swan song as a bridge between Phase Three and Phase Four as the legend of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings grows. Which it will. Shang-Chi is a confident and worthy addition to the MCU roster, now 25 films deep.

        The power for this film, however, comes through in the eyes of his father, Wenwu. One of the movie’s most brilliant choices is casting Tony Leung so that can repeat the same magic he’s had from countless romances and dramas in Hong Kong. Leung rules this movie. With the same silent passion and stillness that made “In the Mood for Love” one of the greatest romances of all time, Leung destroys armies, raises a family, and struggles to resist destructive grief; his presence is made all the more powerful by the ten blue rings that help him slingshot around and destroy whatever is in his path.

        “Shang-Chi"'s thrilling’s embrace of clarity, of nudging your imagination instead of doing all the work for you, spreads the inspired special effects that enhance the magic of this story and the world of its characters. There’s an evocative use of water—it bursts from walls, floats in the air, and makes a map of icicles—a striking way of depicting a moment that usually would just get a hologram. The movie even throws in a charming animated cute sidekick that cleverly subverts the expectations of cute faces on plush-looking sidekicks. The dominating usage of CGI—the kind that requires dark clouds, as we saw in the grand battle of “Avengers: Endgame”—is saved for the last massive sequence, which is such an over-the-top, giddy, rollercoaster ride that you can’t help but root for it.

        For fans of the MCU, there is a lot to like from Marvel over the last decade and this impressive run of blockbuster moviemaking. One of the best treats though has been watching Marvel expand its horizons in multiple ways. Marvel’s superpower with the MCU has been its ability to seamlessly blend their storytelling and brand with established genre fare or expanding to embrace more cultures; Shang-Chi, like Black Panther before it, accomplishes both.

        the movie's ending leaves the door open for further deepening into the mystery of Shang-chi's situation as well as being part of the larger established of the Marvel Superhero universe
